FDA
Sweep from: 			Start frequency of the experiment.
to: 	   			Stop frequency of the experiment.
Amplitude:   			The peak-peak voltage of the input signals.
ODR (Output data ratio): 		The Acquisition rate of the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter).
RTIA (Trans resistance amplifier): 	The value of resistance in trans resistance amplifier
DFT (Discrete Fourier transform): 	The number of points in DFT
Points: 				The amount of points in a curve.
Single Measurement: 		Set the duration time for the experiment
Multiple Measurement: 		Start date and Stop date, repeat times per period, repeat times per cycle

TD
The frequency in TD is fixed, and other parameters are the same as Frequency Domain Analysis and its Single Measurement.

DC
Start at: 				The start voltage
Amplitude: 			The maximum voltage
There are two models about the input signals:
	Sweep:			Select the shape of the input signals, Square wave or Triangle wave at first, 
				then set the amount of the points in a wave by moving the slide.
	Duration: 			Set the duration time and the  measurement times during the time.

Combination
Step1: Set the parameters as the Frequency Domain Analysis and its multiple measurement.
Step2: Set the peak amplitude of the DC signal and the duration time , which is always very short, often as 30-60s. 
	(This operation is to energize the electrode so that the silver electrode undergoes a chlorination reaction to generate a silver chloride electrode)
Step3: Select whether the temperature in the experiment is measured or not.
